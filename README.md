# Portfolio
This is the project where I developed my whole portfolio website using ReactJS. Here I showcased 
my project and other information about myself. 

Creating a portfolio for myself from what I have learned is amazing and it is challenging while 
creating route to different component. I routed the component using react-router-dom package
for routing to different components.
