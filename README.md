# Portfolio
This is the project where I developed my whole portfolio website using ReactJS. Here I showcased 
my project and other information about myself. Creating a portfolio for myself from what I have 
learned is amazing and it is challenging while creating route to different component. I routed the
component using react-router-dom package for routing to different components.

This project folder consist of all the source code to run the portfolio website except the node_manager
folder. You have to download the node_manager defore starting the server.
